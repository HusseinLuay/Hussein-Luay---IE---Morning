    <h3>1. What is the web development and what are types of it?</h3>
    <p>
        Web Programming (or web development) is the art of constructing and maintaining web pages 
        for websites by a web developer (also known as a web engineer) to give the user what he needs from the 
        website.
    </p>

    <p>the types of web development :</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Frontend</li>
        <li>Backend</li>
        <li>Fullstack</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. What is difference between web developers and web designers</h3>
    <p>
        web developer focus on the technical aspects of building a website, including coding, server management, and database management.
        and he is Proficient in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP) and
        he handle the functionality and interactivity of a site, ensuring it works smoothly and efficiently
    </p>
    
    <p>
        web designer focus is on the visual aspects and user experience of a website.
        so he Proficient in design tools (like: Adobe XD, Sketch , figma ) and have an understanding of UI/UX principles.
        he create layouts, choose color schemes, design graphics, and ensure a site's aesthetics align with the brand or purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Is the best for web developer to be full stack development or just one type of development?</h3>
    <p>
        In my opinion, there is no specific answer to this question, 
        as a person can choose one aspect and specialize in it, whether he is a front-end developer or a back-end developer,
        but he must always know and understand the other side in order to understand how the site works... 
        Therefore, in my opinion, a person should study a full stack and Then specialize and continue
        developing a specific aspect if he so desires
