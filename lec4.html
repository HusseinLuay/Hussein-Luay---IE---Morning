    <h3>Not recommended to use tables for HTML layout, why?</h3>
    <pre>
Using tables for layout in HTML is generally not recommended because it goes against the principles of semantic HTML and can lead 
to a variety of issues:

Semantics: HTML tables are meant for displaying tabular data, not for layout purposes. When you use tables for layout, you're not using
HTML in a way that accurately represents the content on your page. This can make your code less understandable for both humans and
assistive technologies like screen readers.

Accessibility: Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on the semantic structure of HTML to provide context to users. 
When tables are used for layout, it can confuse these technologies and make it harder for users with disabilities to navigate and
understand your content.

Responsive Design: Tables don't lend themselves well to responsive design. They are inherently rigid and can be difficult to style
and adapt for different screen sizes. Using modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox or Grid is more flexible and allows for 
better responsiveness.

Maintenance: Tables can lead to more complex and harder-to-maintain code. When you use CSS for layout, you separate the content (HTML)
from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to update and modify the layout without affecting the underlying content.

Performance: Tables can lead to slower page loading times, especially if they're used excessively. This is because the browser
needs to render the entire table before displaying anything on the page. Modern CSS-based layouts can often be more efficient.

SEO: While search engines are quite sophisticated, using tables for layout may still affect how they interpret and rank your content.
Semantic HTML helps search engines understand the structure and meaning of your content.

Compatibility: Some older browsers or non-standard browsers may not handle tables for layout as well as they do modern CSS layouts.

while tables are a powerful tool for presenting tabular data, they're not the right tool for page layout. It's better to use CSS 
for layout purposes, as it's more flexible, maintainable, and in line with the semantic structure of HTML.
