    <!-- 1. What are the limitations of CSS ? -->
    <!-- 
        1 - Limited Layout Control: CSS has limitations when it comes to complex layout control. 
        While it has improved with the introduction of Flexbox and Grid, achieving certain layouts may 
        still require workarounds or the use of additional tools like CSS frameworks. <br>

        2 - Lack of Variables: CSS traditionally lacked variables, which made it challenging to manage 
        and reuse values throughout a stylesheet. However, CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less have introduced
         the concept of variables.
